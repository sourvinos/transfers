This is the basic template of Angular with SSL for Linux.

The template was created with ASP.NET Core 2.1: dotnet new angular project-name

Instructions how to create the certificate are here 
https://www.humankode.com/asp-net-core/develop-locally-with-https-self-signed-certificates-and-asp-net-core
under the paragraph "Create a Self-Signed Certificate and trust it on Ubuntu Linux"

I just love to see the green padlock and the message "Connection is secure"
